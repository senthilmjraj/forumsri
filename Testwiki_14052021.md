## Barcode Based Item search

## Manual Stock take via Retailer App
  * Enable the Retailers to capture the current stock position of the items in shelf / Backstore and generate the stock report 

## Automated Stock take (I.e Image Scan based stock take and OOS alerts to retailer)
Reference URL :
Object detection with deep learning and OpenCV - PyImageSearch

 * Enable the Retailers to scan the Item and identify the stock qty associated with that item image and pick the stock qty and add it to the current stock 
 * Out of stock items alert to be sent to the retailer to generate order recommendation
 
## Sales return / Damages 
  * Enable the Retailers to capture the Sales return and damages qty against the item along with return reasons / photo and generate the debit note for the same and share it with the distributor

 * Generated Debit note has to get  approved by the distributor and that should be made available for the retailer and added to his wallet , which can get  encashed against the outstanding bills 

## Item level Order recommendations based on current stock position & previous order qty
  * Based on Last 2 week Stock take / sales return / New Invoice qty , we can able to predict the total sales happened at the outlet in current week  and derive the Minimum order Qty (MOQ) as order recommendations for next week 

 * I.e Total Qty sold will be taken as MOQ for new order placement  

    **Total Qty sold = (Last week stock Position + New Stock inward) - (Current week stock Position) - (Last week Sales return Qty)
